it is a machine of little substance transforming  
it is not a machine of memory (memory is the algae  
of its fascination; gorging on the lesser fish)  

it is a machine   
votive content generation is key  
n-gram analysis for net promoters, satisfaction  

surfeit of saturations  
talking about material  
your expanded feature vector  

the smallest, clearest niche  
in the smallest place between the chance  
of me and necessity of you  

not an autumn field with a collision of winds  
not the itinerant man-'o-war on the open sea  
but the smallest box, the shoehorn  

the lee shore niche  
the uncanny valley niche  
the prison niche  

the master-slave niche  
deep-learning niche, nesting niche  
world-building niche  

your-rights niche  
universal niche  
omnivorous niche
